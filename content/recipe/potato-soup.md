*Ingredients*:
__high pressure__
- 5 pound bag of Yukon or Russet potatoes peeled and cubed
- 1 medium onion diced
- 4 cloves garlic minced
- 1 cup celery diced
- 1/2 tablespoon dried thyme
- 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes optional
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 can 12oz evaporated milk

__after high pressure__
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 2 cups cheddar cheese shredded
- 1/2 cup sour cream room temperature

*Directions*:
1. Add all the ingredients listed under "high pressure" to the pot. Make sure you don't go over the inner Max line of your pot
1. Stir to combine.
1. Close and lock the lid, point knob to sealed.
1. Press High Pressure and input 10 minutes. It will take the Instant Pot to come to pressure about 15-20 minutes, due to the high volume of the soup.
1. Once done cooking, do a 10-minute Natural Pressure Release, after which, carefully release the remaining pressure by moving the knob to the Vent position.
1. Lift the lid and use a potato masher to mash some of the potatoes.
1. In a cup whisk cornstarch and cream until well combined and smooth.
1. Select Saut√©, and whisk in cream mixture until fully combined. Simmer for a few minutes, until the soup thickens. If the soup is too thick, add more cream or broth, and simmer.
1. Stir in sour cream.
1. Turn off the pressure cooker and stir in cheddar cheese until melted.
1. Serve hot with preferred garnishes.

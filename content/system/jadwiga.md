Jadwiga has two coats; in summer, her fur is predominantly silver, with white chest and belly, and Byzantium purple socks (to the knee), gloves (to the elbow), and tailtip (last third of her tail). In winter, she is pure white, with light blue socks, gloves, and tailtip in lieu of summer's purple. Her eyes are ice blue, like SÃ­le's. (Note that the purple and light blue are dyes, not natural pigmentation.)

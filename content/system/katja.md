Katja's coat is predominantly black, with green socks (to the knee), gloves (to the elbow), and tailtip (last third of faer tail), a white chest and belly, and a white spot on faer chin. Faer eyes are ice blue. (Note that the green colour is dye, not natural pigmentation.)

Katja is the facet you're going to interact with the vast majority of the time, as fae is the most comfortable for Amethyst to 'wear'.

Katja can shapeshift between anthro and non-anthro forms, as well as switch her physical age between 3 and 8. She also has temperature-control magic: she can exude heat, as mammals normally do, or cold, as as e.g. an ice pack normally does.

Eltanin is a red fox (as in V. vulpes) as big as a golden retriever. They have silvery fur, and the inside of their ears is a lighter shade. Their chest and belly fur is the same shade as their ear-fluff. They have green eyes. They have a pair of goat-like horns between their ears that curve toward their back. They have dragon wings, with a wingspan twice as wide as they are long.

title: System Reference
description: A set of documents describing the Amethyst system.
---
The Amethyst system is a **median** system, meaning that the alters, the individuals comprising the system, have significant overlap.

**Amethyst** was chosen because the metaphor we use to describe ourself is a gemstone, and both because of that and because we're a median system, our alters are called 'facets'. All of our facets, including our core (Síle), are furries. Please be aware that Síle is the identity we use when interacting with people offline, and in professional-ish settings online.

Because Katja fronts 99.9% of the time, we will generally use singular pronouns when referring to ourselves outside of system contexts, such as in [our About page](/about/).

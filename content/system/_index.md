The Amethyst system is a **median** system, meaning that the alters, the individuals comprising the system, have significant overlap.

**Amethyst** was chosen because the metaphor we use to describe ourself is a gemstone, and both because of that and because we're a median system, our alters are called 'facets'. Except for Amethyst itself, the core, all of our facets are furries.

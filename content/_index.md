Welcome! This site is a handy collection of links to my various accounts, as well as information about us and our endeavors.

We are primarily nonverbal; we prefer to communicate in text unless verbal communication is required. We are deafblind, which is maintained in all of our facets; we use hearing aids and a white cane where possible.
